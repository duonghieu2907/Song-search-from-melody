# About the Project Section

# Abstract Display
st.markdown("""
**Abstract:**

This report presents the development of a melody-based song search system designed to address the limitations of traditional text-based music retrieval methods.  
By enabling users to search for songs through humming, whistling, or uploading audio files, the system offers a more intuitive and accessible way of finding music.  

The core of the system is powered by the **Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP)** model for robust audio embedding extraction and the **Milvus vector database** for scalable and efficient similarity search.  

### Highlights:
- **Dataset Preparation**: Automated crawling and processing of audio content from YouTube.
- **Preliminary Evaluations**: Promising results for standard audio inputs, such as clear recordings, but challenges remain for noisier inputs like humming and whistling.
- **Future Directions**:
  - Refining the embedding extraction pipeline.
  - Expanding the dataset with diverse user-generated queries.
  - Optimizing the system for real-world scalability.

This system paves the way for inclusive music search solutions, catering to users regardless of their knowledge of song names or lyrics.

# Overview Section
st.subheader("üîç Overview")
st.markdown("""
Our melody-based song search system leverages cutting-edge machine learning and vector similarity search techniques to revolutionize music retrieval.  
Key features of the system include:
- **Audio Input Options**: Users can hum, whistle, or upload an MP3 file to search for songs intuitively.
- **Real-time Processing**: The optimized backend ensures quick results with high accuracy.
- **Inclusive Search**: Designed to work regardless of your knowledge of song names or lyrics.
""")

# System Architecture Section
st.subheader("üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture")
st.markdown("""
The system is built with a robust and scalable architecture to handle diverse user inputs and deliver fast, accurate results. The core components are:
1. **Frontend**:  
   - A streamlined and intuitive web interface for user interactions.  
   - Built using **Streamlit** for ease of deployment and responsiveness.
2. **Backend**:  
   - Processes input audio and extracts embeddings using the **CLAP** model for feature extraction.  
   - Performs similarity search using the **Milvus vector database**.
3. **Database**:  
   - Embedding storage using Milvus, enabling scalable and efficient retrieval.  
   - Supports a large corpus of song embeddings for extensive coverage.
